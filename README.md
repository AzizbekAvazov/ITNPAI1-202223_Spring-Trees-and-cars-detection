# Trees-and-cars-detection
The objective of this project is to develop a computer vision program that can detect trees and cars from images using Python programming language. The program should be able to take input images in various formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.) and identify regions of the image that contain either a tree or a car.

The program should use a combination of image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately detect trees and cars. It should be able to differentiate between different types of trees and cars (e.g., deciduous trees, coniferous trees, SUVs, sedans, etc.) and accurately locate them within the image.

The program should be robust enough to handle different lighting conditions, weather conditions, and camera angles. It should also be able to handle images with multiple trees and cars in them, and accurately label each object in the image.

The output of the program should be a list of bounding boxes that contain the detected trees and cars, along with their respective labels. The program should also be able to visualize the detected objects on the input image.

Overall, the goal of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate computer vision program that can detect trees and cars from images for various applications, such as autonomous vehicles, environmental monitoring, and city planning.
